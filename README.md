# CFMS Server

CFMS (Classified File Management System), is a complete solution for 
managing confidential documents. This is the repository used to 
implement server functionality.

The Project is still in the early stages of development and cannot 
guarantee the security and stability of running the Service. 

Welcome to Github Issues for improvements and bug reports.

## Alpha Test

This is a project that is under active development and we are looking 
for people interested in the project to participate in testing. We are 
well aware that the system still has huge shortcomings as a functional 
solution â€“ and we want as many people as possible to join in improving 
them.

We sometimes codename our versions from this period. The code name of 
this edition is: **The Literary Artist of Timeline.**
